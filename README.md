# Rival Regions Account Manager

## Intro
The reason I wrote this README.md file because I just got back into this project after three months and I forget how everything worked while I was gone. So this is my attempt at a documentation for people that are new to this project.

## About 
This is an account manager for Rival Regions. It will have basic function to handle your account because you think that the basic gameplay of RR is a waste of time and that's why you're looking for something to automate that. That's why this program is created to prevent you from engaging in the gameplay of Rival Regions and focus on other more interesting way to spend your time. 

So far I have though about doing something about the following things.
- work in a factory
- building military academy
- work in selected departments
- vote for your party

This those are the things that I think are most important. I'll see how this project will progress in the future.
